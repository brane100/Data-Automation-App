# Data Automation App

## Overview

The **Data Automation App** is an innovative mobile application that allows you to control your mobile data or Wi-Fi connectivity using just your voice. Unlike Google Assistant or other voice-based assistants, this app doesn't require an active internet connection to function. It recognizes your voice commands and automatically turns on/off your mobile data or Wi-Fi, ensuring that you can stay connected without needing an internet connection for the voice recognition itself.

This app is still under development, and its aim is to provide a reliable and efficient tool to manage your connectivity seamlessly.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Activate mobile data or Wi-Fi using voice commands.
- **No Internet Needed**: Unlike other voice assistants, this app doesn't require an internet connection for processing voice commands.
- **Control Connectivity**: Easily switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi networks.
- **Offline Functionality**: Operates fully offline, making it more efficient and independent from external networks.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using your preferred method (e.g., Gradle, NPM, etc.).
3. Build and deploy the app on your device.

## How It Works

1. **Voice Command Recognition**: The app listens for predefined voice commands like "Turn on data" or "Enable Wi-Fi."
2. **Connectivity Toggle**: Upon detecting the command, it automatically toggles your mobile data or Wi-Fi connectivity.
3. **Offline Mode**: The app does not rely on the internet to process voice commands, making it a more efficient alternative to other online assistants.

## Supported Devices
