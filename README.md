# Data Automation App

## Overview

The **Data Automation App** is an innovative mobile application that aims to enable users to control their mobile data or Wi-Fi connectivity using voice commands. Unlike Google Assistant or other voice-based assistants, this app will not require an active internet connection to function. The app will recognize your voice commands and automatically toggle your mobile data or Wi-Fi, providing a seamless connectivity experience without needing internet for voice recognition.

This app is still under development, and it is not yet available for public use. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient tool to manage your mobile connectivity.

## Features (Planned)

- **Voice Recognition**: Activate mobile data or Wi-Fi using voice commands.
- **No Internet Needed**: Unlike other voice assistants, this app won't require an internet connection to process voice commands.
- **Control Connectivity**: Easily toggle between mobile data and Wi-Fi networks.
- **Offline Functionality**: The app will operate fully offline, enhancing efficiency by not relying on external networks.

## Installation (Upcoming Release)

The app is still under development, and installation instructions will be available once the app is released. For now, you can follow these general steps once it becomes available:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using your preferred method (e.g., Gradle, NPM, etc.).
3. Build and deploy the app on your Android device.

## How It Will Work

1. **Voice Command Recognition**: The app will listen for predefined voice commands, such as "Turn on data" or "Enable Wi-Fi."
2. **Connectivity Toggle**: Upon recognizing the command, the app will toggle mobile data or Wi-Fi on or off.
3. **Offline Mode**: The app will work offline, making it a more efficient solution compared to voice assistants that rely on an active internet connection.
